## How to use

First, you'll need to install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) if you don't have it already,
then fork this repository, enter it and run:

```
npm install
```

Wait for the dependencies to install and run the command:

```
gulp
```

To start a local `http server`, then open a browser and visit: `localhost:8000` to see the app running.  

The server is listening for changes in files, so if you edit and save a file in your editor, the server will reload the app.
